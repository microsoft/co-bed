class DotProductCritic(nn.Module):
    """
    A critic ùëà that takes two quantities, ùë• and ùë¶, as inputs and returns a real number.

    In the context of BED, we want to take as input some observations ùë¶ and some quantity of interest ùë•
    (which we wish to gain information about). These usually live in different spaces, so we first encode
    them (e.g. with two MLPs) so they are in the same space and of the same dimension.

    A dot product critic is defined as the dot product between the encodings:
        ùëà(ùë•, ùë¶) = ùê∏‚ÇÅ(ùë•)·µÄùê∏‚ÇÇ(ùë¶)
    Optionally, the dot product can be scaled by sqrt(encoding_dimension), i.e.
         ùëà(ùë•, ùë¶) = ùê∏‚ÇÅ(ùë•)·µÄùê∏‚ÇÇ(ùë¶) / sqrt(encoding_dimension)
